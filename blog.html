   		<h3>Assignment 1 -- 4/6/2020 </h3>
			<p> It took me about 4 hours to complete this assignment, mostly because I had never used
				Github before. My information processing style functions in a way where I like to get
				straight to the point. I like to tinker around and try things. I don't like to read through
				lots of documentation or sit through videos. Therefore, I mostly searched Google for exactly
				what I needed to do, such as "how to clone a repository". I had some major troubles trying
				to publish my webpage. First, I tried to do it through the engr web space with connecting
				to the server. However, I kept getting 404 errors, even though I changed the permissions
				so that everyone could read it. I spent lots of time trying to figure it out. Ultimately,
				I couldnt' get it to work so I transitioned to trying to use Github Pages. I was ultimately
				able to figure it out from reading the documentation. I knew nothing about HTML before things
				assignment. </p>
			<p>From this assignment, I learned basic html syntax. I learned how to set up a file
				and how to type different headings and lists by using h1 and ul. I mostly used Rob Hess's
				google doc notes, as they were very helpful. I also utilized notes frm lecture, random google
				searches, and small pieces of Gihub documentation. </p>
