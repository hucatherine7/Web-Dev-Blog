   		<h3>Assignment 2 -- 4/27/2020 </h3>
			<p> It took me about 20 hours over the span of a couple day to complete this assignment.
        I reviewed the class lectures, and googled any concepts that I didn't completely understand.
        I got very sucked into the many styles, trying to get it took look as close as possible
        to the mocks. I probably could've spent even longer trying to refine my code. Specifically,
        I had a hard time making the boxes change order when the screen shrunk. I was able to find
        the answer by googling it and someone else had the same issue. I was then able to understand
        the code and used the display flex wrap syntaxes to solve the issue. I knew nothing about
        css before this, and this assignment helped a lot. I learn best by working through things,
        so listening to lectures is not super helpful to me. I learn well through trial and error,
        so I now understand more about css. I specifically had to google how to do the shadow for the icon in
        the lower right corner. I don't remember covering that in the lecture, and I didn't have
        any idea how to do it. I also had to look up what each argument of the margin syntax was,
        because I forgot. I did not use osu resources, but next assignment I plan to use TA office hours
        if needed. </p>
			<p>From this assignment, I learned basic html syntax. I learned how to set up a file
				and how to type different headings and lists by using h1 and ul. I mostly used Rob Hess's
				google doc notes, as they were very helpful. I also utilized notes frm lecture, random google
				searches, and small pieces of Gihub documentation. </p>
